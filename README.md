# Voice Verification

**The problem domain chosen is voice identification, a continuation of from voice verification from Johns’ & Sinette’s Machine Learning project.**

Creating a voice recognition system in Python using a local dataset typically involves using a machine learning model to process audio samples and classify them into different categories. Here's a basic outline of how you could approach this task:

1. Collect and Preprocess Data: Gather a dataset of audio samples along with their corresponding labels. Preprocess the audio data as needed, such as converting it to a standard format, extracting features, and normalizing the data.

2. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the audio samples. Common techniques include Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms, or raw waveform data.

3. Model Training: Train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data. Popular models for audio classification include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or more advanced architectures like Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs).

4. Validation and Testing: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using a separate validation set. Tune hyperparameters and adjust the model architecture as needed to improve performance. Finally, test the model on a separate testing set to assess its generalization ability.

5. Integration with Speech Recognition: Implement a mechanism to record and preprocess audio input from the user. You can use libraries like pyaudio or sounddevice for recording audio in Python. Then, feed the recorded audio data into the trained model for classification.

This example provides a basic framework for building a voice recognition system using a local dataset in Python. Depending on your specific requirements and the complexity of your dataset, you may need to explore more sophisticated techniques and models. Additionally, consider the computational resources available to you, as processing audio data and training machine learning models can be resource-intensive tasks.
